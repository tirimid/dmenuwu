# dmenuwu

## Introduction
This is a fork of dmenu with very minor changes for my personal usage. I tend to
always download and modify dmenu on any Linux system, so I just made this as a
way to get my main changes faster.

# Dependencies
Software / system dependencies are:
* Xlib header files
* Hermit font

# Management
* To build dmenuwu, run `make`
* To install dmenuwu, run `make install`
* To uninstall dmenuwu, run `make uninstall`

# Usage
Since this is just a fork of dmenu, it's used in basically the same way. The
main difference is that I've ripped out command line option functionality from
dmenu, as I never use it.

# Contributing
Do not contribute to this project. It is my personal fork with changes that only
I want. Contribute upstream instead.
